When OS X Lion came out I was very upset that you could not rearrange the
order of your desktops in Mission Control. The new left-to-right navigation is
so intuitive that it was clearly a major improvement, but the OS is not very
good at deciding the order in which I wish to have full-screen apps appear.
Eventually I just got used to the frustration, stopped using Mission Control
entirely, and forgot about the whole thing. Luckily, someone at Apple snuck
the feature into 10.7.2 on October 12th.

A month and a half later, I discovered this godsend after I opened Mission
Control intending to drag IntelliJ from one space to another and then decided
on an intuitive impulse to try rearranging my desktops along the top of the
screen. It worked! A moment of confusion followed in which I thought I might
be living in an alternate universe or perhaps that I was an idiot who had all
this time never known that this was possible. Then I looked online and saw
that I wasn't crazy. Anyway, this is really good news and makes the Lion's
Spaces feature much more usable and gives me a reason to open Mission Control
again. Hooray!

I'm curious as to how many people also didn't notice this until much later.
