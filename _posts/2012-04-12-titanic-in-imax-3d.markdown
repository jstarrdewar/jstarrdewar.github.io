The Titanic sank 100 years ago today.  I have always been obsessed with it, ever since I was a little kid.  I had a picture book about the discovery of the wreck, and I watched a National Geographic channel documentary about it over and over.  So when Titanic came out I was thrilled and I went to see it three times in the theater.  I've watched it a couple of times on home video since then, and enjoyed it every time.  Now James Cameron has gone back and redone the whole thing in 3D.  I was pretty skeptical that it could be done, because there is so much water in this film, and anything transparent or reflective causes major problems for the 3D conversion process.  But I went to see it anyway.

As it turns out, Titanic in IMAX 3D was absolutely amazing and worthwhile. They have it filling the entire IMAX screen, and for the most part it looks like it was filmed in IMAX. There are very few resolution problems (except for the end credits, but who cares). The 3D conversion is excellent, although there were probably about two dozen shots with distracting conversion artifacts.

In particular, the exterior shots were problematic throughout the film with flattened reflections and optical flow artifacts around the deck railings. Since most of those shots were CG, I was a little surprised they didn't try to re-render them.  I can think of a lot of reasons why not; perhaps it was too expensive, or ILM didn't have the assets in good condition, or they thought it would be disrespectful to the artists who worked on the original film.

The worst problems were in the scenes with the classic motorcars. The cars had really distracting problems with refraction and reflection. Other problem areas were any of the eating scenes, because the crystal is very problematic.  I think the problems with the car would be easier to solve; just overlay a fully rendered CG car over the top of the filmed vehicle.  But the crystal is tougher since it's partially transparent.  I wonder if it would be possible to paint out the glasses in the film and then render new glasses and try to fake the environment. It would be pretty hard to make it work.

There were several long shots of the ship sinking that had major problems with the reflection.  I thought this was a missed opportunity because it seems to me it would be pretty easy to replace the water.  If you wrapped geometry around the ship and added a water plane you could calculate a new reflection.  Since the water around the lifeboats and splashes was disturbed, you'd be able to to roto those out and place them over the newly rendered water layer.

I know I'm one of the few people who would notice these things but I'm a little disappointed that they didn't go for perfection. In a movie with thousands of shots really well done, it's a shame that there are a couple dozen left with problems. Given the advances in CG since 1997 I think a lot of the problems could be fixed with sufficient budget, and maybe they will be for the _200th_ anniversary re-release.

At any rate, I think it qualifies as the best 3D theatergoing experience since Avatar. It was certainly a more immersive experience than Transformers 3, and it's much better movie than Tron: Legacy. It's a must see.
