I'm going to make a prediction: the Mac Pro is dead.  [Here's why](http://gizmodo.com/5879314/how-is-this-supercharged-macbook-air-editing-crazy-hd-video).  Instead, I think we may see an Apple-branded Thunderbolt extension case aimed at users of iMacs and high-end MacBook Pros with the same basic layout: quiet fans and easy access to internals but without the processors and maybe even without the hard drives.

It would be much more portable, which would make it a lot easier to bring on set for doing test comps and other production tasks.  Anyone who has tried to carry a Mac Pro in a shock-proof crush-proof case up a flight of stairs will breathe a sigh of relief.

There were [rumors of a rack-mountable 3U version of the Mac Pro](http://www.macrumors.com/2011/04/21/apple-developing-narrower-rackmountable-mac-pro-prototypes/) but I think it's unlikely.  OS X server is not a very attractive product, and I doubt that they are making much money from it. It's hard to believe that someone who has done their research wouldn't favor a cheaper solution over a Mac Pro unless it was a small business with just one or two servers looking for ease-of-administration (and even then they might be [disappointed](http://arstechnica.com/apple/reviews/2012/01/is-lion-server-suitable-for-home-use-ars-investigates.ars)).  I find it doubtful that sort of customer would invest in a rack.  They'd probably just set the computer on the floor in a closet.
