title: Motion Tracking Goes a Long Way Towards Eliminating VR Sickness
comments: true

VR sickness is one of the effects of using the Oculus Rift that caught me by surprise.  I’d heard about it from others but didn’t think I would be susceptible.  I never get seasick, carsick or airsick, and I’ve only ever vomited as a result of run-ins with the norovirus.  However, I have found that the Rift can make me feel like heaving in no time.

Now, people have claimed that tracking body position with the Razer Hydra largely eliminates VR sickness.  ‘Teddy’ is a big proponent of this.  You can check out his work [here on YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-92rvc_Y-E).

For myself, playing the Teddy’s HydraDeck demos didn’t totally eliminate VR sickness so I wasn’t sure how effective the technique really is (HydraDeck adds mechanics where you have to physically bend down to reach golden orbs, so it’s pushing the envelope a bit).  Then last night I tried out the [latest Half Life VR demo](http://vrmods.wordpress.com/).  

At first I tried playing in `mt_control_mode 0`, which doesn’t have positional tracking.  Instead you hold a hydra controller in each hand.  Now it should be said that of all the Rift demos I’ve tried, Half Life 2 makes me sick the fastest, and this time was no different, although the mod gets rid of some of the more egregious problems like the loading freeze-frames which were extremely disorienting before.  I had to take the rift off after about 15 minutes and recover.

Next, I tried `mt_control_mode 2`.  In this version, all of the controls are mapped to the right controller, and you wrap the left controller around your neck to provide positional tracking.  The positional tracking effect is pretty subtle.  Unless you explicitly stop and lean around corners to enjoy the effect, you won’t notice it.  I certainly didn’t while being pursued through the railyard by the police.  Yet it made a tremendous difference in how I felt.  This time I played for about 45 minutes and felt fine when I took off the rift.

The mod promotes Half Life 2 from the bottom of my favorite Rift demos list to near the top.  There are still some issues, of course.  It’s difficult to attach the hydra and it needs to be somewhat level or else your forward direction drifts too rapidly.  I couldn’t entirely get rid of the directional drift either, and when the Hydra direction gets out of sync with the Rift’s positional tracker your leaning direction gets out of whack, and that makes you feel very strange indeed.  We’ll probably have to wait for the STEM or even the next version of the rift to resolve this issue for good.

In [this recent PCWorld interview](http://www.pcworld.com/article/2053682/oculus-rift-team-talks-steam-support-hamster-balls-and-90s-vr-at-indiecade.html), Nate Mitchell said that the consumer Rift would launch with an emphasis on cockpit games, and that makes sense; they are a lot more gentle on VR newcomers, and making your customers sick on Christmas morning is bad business.  

The good news is that Half Life VR proves that it’s possible to make a playable First-Person Shooter that can be enjoyed by people who are not extremely acclimatized to VR.  The trouble is that if it requires an additional $300 investment in a STEM tracker, it may limit the audience too much to make an addressable market in the near term.

(In a [recent interview with Brendan Iribe on Polygon](http://www.polygon.com/2013/10/17/4850272/oculus-ceo-gets-sick-from-vr-but-says-hes-found-the-remedy) it was revealed that a prototype Rift with positional tracking is working very well.  According to John Carmack in [yet another interview](http://www.engadget.com/2013/10/18/oculus-rift-john-carmack-interview/) – in the video at 3:30 – the final Rift will utilize optical tracking rather than electromagnetic tracking like the STEM and hydra.)
