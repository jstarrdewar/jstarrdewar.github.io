title: I've Redesigned My Blog Again
comments: true
---

For its second anniversary, I’ve redesigned my blog. Now it’s a pure Jekyll site. I felt like I didn’t need all of Octopress’ features since most people are hitting the site from Google.  Some of the features broke and I didn’t feel like upgrading them. I wanted something minimal – even utilitarian – yet cheerful. 

I’ve upped the font size to make the site a more “correct” from a typographical standpoint. I found the all-white page of the previous design a bit too blinding on my 27” monitor so I’ve made the background light gray. I think you can tell when an engineer designed a website because they’ll do it in shades of gray for the sake of their poor tired eyes. Well, I guess I’m no different in that regard. I hope you enjoy the new&nbsp;look!

If you’re looking for an awesome full-featured Octopress theme for a geeky developer blog, I almost decided to use the Bootstrap 3 theme available here: [Octostrap 3](https://github.com/kAworu/octostrap3).
