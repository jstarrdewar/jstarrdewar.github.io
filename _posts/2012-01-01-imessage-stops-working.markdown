I had a weird thing happen this weekend. My iPhone stopped sending and
receiving iMessages, even though they were still turned on in settings. The
following sequence rectified the issue:

  1. Turn off iMessages
  2. Restart the Phone
  3. Turn iMessages back on
  
Just toggling iMessages didn't do the trick.

The episode made me think about how insidious the whole iMessage thing is. <!-- more --> By
creating a proprietary, zero-configuration messaging service, Apple has
effectively taken advantage of the ridiculous price gouging carriers engage in
with text messages to generate a tremendous amount of favorable peer pressure
among consumers. Everyone is going to try force their friends to upgrade to
iOS 5 or upgrade to an iOS 5 compatible device, just so they don't have to pay
text messaging fees any more.

I know this to be true because I have engaged in this behavior.  So have many of my iPhone-toting friends. All of this peer pressure has generated at least 3 iPhone 4S purchases and 4 or 5
iOS 5 upgrades that otherwise might have taken a lot longer to be achieved.
Third-party messaging services like Ping/Touch never created this kind of
social pressure just because they were difficult to get set up for the
technologically-unsavvy, but Apple's support network makes it easy. For one
thing, it works out of the box; there is only one slider to turn it on. For
another, if it gets too frustrating to explain over the phone one can always say "take it to the Apple
Store and they'll get it set up for you".

It would be great for us consumers if iMessage could plug into other messaging
services like AIM, so we could chat with Android users. But if Apple had
enabled that, I have a feeling it would have diluted the message a bit. "Well
you could buy an iPhone so you could chat with me without setting anything up
but if you'd rather not you can download such and such from such and such app
store...blah blah blah..." Of course, they probably never would end up texting
you for free, but they wouldn't get pushed into an Apple purchase either.
