One of the best pieces of advice for beginning programmers is "Don't Repeat Yourself".  Whenever you find yourself performing drudgework, it's best to take a step back and ask yourself if you have taken the right approach.  By figuring out how to make the computer do the work for you, you will improve your skills and lower your maintenance burden.  

People tend to avoid doing this because they it requires putting some energy into thinking critically about their work.  It always feels like it would be easier to just paste that line of code in a bunch of different places.  That's a form of laziness that will come back to haunt you later.  As a programmer you're paid to think, not to type!

I've written an introductory article about this idea – often referred to as "staying DRY" – as a newsletter for The Code Builders.  You can read it here: <http://thecodebuilders.com/dont-repeat-yourself/>
