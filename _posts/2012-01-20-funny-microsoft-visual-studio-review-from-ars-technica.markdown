Ars technica just posted a hilarious review of Microsoft's attempt to gamify
software development. The achievements offered by Microsoft Visual Studio are
actually pretty fun. It seems like an offshoot of code inspections, or maybe
code quality tools like JSLint or FlexPMD. I just hope that developers don't
get wrapped up in trying to get all of the Running with Scissors/Don't Try
This At Home achievements when they are working on an actual project! That
would be horrifying.

I think it gets at the idea that software development is a lot of fun, and is
much less repetitive than most other jobs involving a computer, although I
disagree with Ars' comparison to a keyboard-based text adventure game. I think
that writing a program is more like completing a very complicated puzzle. Of
course that doesn't make for very exciting copy.
