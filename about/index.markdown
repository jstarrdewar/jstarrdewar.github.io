I am a full-stack web developer working in Los Angeles, CA. I also work in visual effects. I find that the skill sets complement one another nicely, as scripting and DRY principles are important for artists who want to work efficiently on groups of similar shots, while the principles of compositing and rendering are often useful in front-end development when creating advanced interfaces. 

My primary tools on the programming side are JavaScript with jQuery, ActionScript, and Ruby on Rails. My preferred IDE is IntelliJ IDEA. My primary tools on the VFX side are After Effects and Cinema 4D.

I'm really excited about the possibilities of virtual reality being enabled by the Oculus Rift.  I bought one as soon as I found out about it.
