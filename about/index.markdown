I am a full-stack web developer working in Los Angeles, CA. I also work in visual effects. I find that the skill sets complement one another nicely, as scripting and DRY principles are important for artists who want to work efficiently on groups of similar shots, while the principles of compositing and rendering are often useful in front-end development when implementing advanced interface designs. 

My primary tools on the programming side are JavaScript with jQuery, PHP, Node, and Objective-C. My preferred IDE is IntelliJ IDEA (and AppCode for Cocoa programming). My primary tools on the VFX side are After Effects and Cinema 4D.

I have completed major projects for Ford, Nissan, Hyundai, Bosch, Sony, Fox, Warner Bros., and many others. I'm really excited about the possibilities of virtual reality being enabled by the Oculus Rift.  I bought one as soon as I found out about it and have enjoyed it immensely.  Hopefully I'll have a rift demo of my own to show the world before long.
